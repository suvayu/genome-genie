# Data pipeline

We need to understand some concepts and conventions to be able to
understand and write a pipeline of our own using Genome Genie.  This
is discussed in detail in [pipeline.md](pipeline.md).

# Writing your own templates

A pipeline relies on a set of templates to generate the job script
that is eventually submitted to the batch system.  To know more about
how to write these templates, see [templates.md](templates.md).

# Architecture

The architecture of the framework has some advantages as well as
limitations.  These are summarised in
[architecture.md](architecture.md).
